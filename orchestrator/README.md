# Orchestrator

The purpose of the Orchestrator is to have a Google Cloud project that will act as an orchestrator for projects.  These projects can then be used by individuals to create RAD Lab modules. Budgets can be assigned to projects and a function is created to detach the billing account from the GCP project.
